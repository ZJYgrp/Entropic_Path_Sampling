The following command line options and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line options:
    Deprecated:  --cpus-per-proc, -cpus-per-proc, --cpus-per-rank, -cpus-per-rank
    Replacement: --map-by <obj>:PE=N, default <obj>=NUMA

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  rmaps_base_cpus_per_proc
    Replacement: rmaps_base_mapping_policy=<obj>:PE=N, default <obj>=NUMA

The deprecated forms *will* disappear in a future version of Open MPI.
Please update to the new syntax.
